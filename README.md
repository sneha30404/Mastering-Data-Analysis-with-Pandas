# Mastering-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains guided projects from Coursera's learning paths, focusing on **data analysis** using **Pandas**. These projects provide hands-on experience in handling, manipulating, and analyzing data efficiently.

## 🎯 Learning Paths Covered
Through these guided projects, I explored:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing data, duplicates, and outliers.  
- **Data Manipulation** – Sorting, filtering, merging, and reshaping datasets.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Summarizing and visualizing data insights.  
- **Time Series Analysis** – Working with date-time data.  
- **Performance Optimization** – Speeding up Pandas operations with vectorization.  

## 🐼 What is Pandas?
**Pandas** is a powerful **Python library** used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides two primary data structures:
- **Series** – A one-dimensional labeled array.
- **DataFrame** – A two-dimensional table-like structure, similar to an Excel sheet or SQL table.

With Pandas, you can efficiently clean, transform, and analyze datasets, making it an essential tool for data science and machine learning.

## 🚀 Get Started
To use this repository, install Pandas using:

```sh
pip install pandas
